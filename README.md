Idea: 
Create a web application that allows users to keep track of books they’ve read and books they want to read, using Google Books api for book recommendations and searches

-Once logged in, users can go to home page or library page
From home page:
-Users can search for book recommendations via genre or author using GoodReads api
-Users can search for specific book titles via GoodReads api
-Users can add the books from GoodReads api to their personal library
From library page:
-Users can organize books into to their already read, currently reading, and want to read lists
-Users can mark previously read books as favorites
-Users can rank books on want to read list in order of priority

Future Features:
Users will be able to use the same functionality for the books, but for movies as well

Database Contains:
-User info
-Book info for each user
